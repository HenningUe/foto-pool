## 🔄 Workflow Details

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests

**Features**:
- ✅ Install dependencies using `uv`
- ✅ Run unit & integration tests with coverage reporting
- ✅ Run `ruff` linting and formatting checks
- ✅ Run `mypy` type checking
- ✅ Validate PyInstaller specs and build assets
- ✅ Check test coverage threshold (80%+)
- ✅ Upload coverage reports to Codecov

**Platforms**: Ubuntu (multi-Python version support)

### 2. Release and Publishing (`release.yml`)
**Triggers**: GitHub releases, Manual dispatch

**Features**:
- ✅ Build Windows `.exe` executables
- ✅ Build Linux executables
- ✅ Package Linux build for APT repository
- ✅ Package Windows build for WinGet
- ✅ Automatically publish to WinGet (Windows Package Manager)
- ✅ Automatically publish to APT (Ubuntu package manager)
- ✅ Publish releases automatically with comprehensive asset management

**Cross-Platform Building**:
- Windows: PowerShell build script integration
- Linux: Bash build script integration
- Automated testing of built executables
- Comprehensive release asset creation

### 3. Dependency Management (`dependencies.yml`)
**Triggers**: Weekly schedule (Mondays 9 AM UTC), Manual dispatch

**Features**:
- Automated dependency updates using `uv sync --upgrade`
- Security audit using `pip-audit` and `safety`
- Automated PR creation for dependency updates
- Test execution with updated dependencies

### 4. Nightly Builds (`nightly.yml`)
**Triggers**: Daily schedule (2 AM UTC), Manual dispatch

**Features**:
- Extended test suite on multiple platforms (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Performance benchmarks and memory usage analysis
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Automated issue creation on failure
- Build process validation across platforms

### 5. Code Quality (`quality.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests

**Features**:
- Detailed code quality analysis with `ruff` and `mypy`
- Security scanning with `bandit` and `safety`
- Documentation coverage checking
- License compliance validation
- Configuration file validation
- Dependency analysis and reporting

## 📦 Package Management

### APT Repository (Linux)
- **Debian package creation** with proper control files
- **Desktop entry** for application launcher
- **Documentation packaging** (README, LICENSE)
- **Dependency specification** (libc6, libssl3)
- **Architecture targeting** (amd64)

### WinGet (Windows)
- **Manifest generation** for Windows Package Manager
- **Multi-file installer support** (main app + credentials manager)
- **Metadata inclusion** (publisher, license, tags)
- **Version management** and update handling
- **Integration with GitHub releases**

## 🧪 Testing Integration

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests integrated into CI pipeline
- ✅ Integration tests with mocked dependencies
- ✅ Cross-platform testing (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- ✅ Build process validation
- ✅ Security and dependency auditing

### Quality Gates
- **80% test coverage** requirement
- **Code formatting** with `ruff format`
- **Type checking** with `mypy`
- **Security scanning** with multiple tools
- **Documentation validation**

## 🚀 Release Process

### Automated Release Flow
1. **Trigger**: Create GitHub release or manual workflow dispatch
2. **Testing**: Full test suite execution on all platforms
3. **Building**: Cross-platform executable generation
4. **Packaging**: APT and WinGet package creation
5. **Publishing**: Automatic upload to GitHub releases
6. **Distribution**: Package manager submission preparation

### Release Assets
- **Windows Package**: `iphoto-downloader-windows-x64.zip`
- **Linux Package**: `iphoto-downloader-linux-x64.tar.gz`
- **Individual Executables**: Platform-specific binaries
- **Package Manager Files**: APT .deb and WinGet manifests

## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
