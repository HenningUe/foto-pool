## 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚öôÔ∏è Core Logic

### 2.1 Core Sync Logic

- [x] Implement **iCloud authentication** using `pyicloud`
- [x] Implement **configurable local sync directory**
- [x] Develop logic to:
  - [x] List all photos in iCloud
  - [x] Identify which photos already exist locally
  - [x] Check local deletion database for deleted photos
  - [x] Download only new photos
  - [ ] Download of albums shall be possible.
  - [ ] Photos should be placed in the corresponding subfolder of their album.
- [x] Ensure **idempotent runs** (no duplicates)
- [x] Add **dry-run mode** to show sync actions without modifying files

#### 2.1.1 Album Filtering & Selection

- [ ] Implement **personal album filtering**:
  - [ ] Add `include_personal_albums` boolean configuration parameter
  - [ ] Add `personal_album_names_to_include` comma-separated list parameter in
        .env
  - [ ] Based `personal_album_names_to_include` in .env a equally named variable
        shall be used inside the python code, which takes the value from .env
        and splits this into single string items, putting them into an list
  - [ ] Implement logic to skip personal albums if
        `include_personal_albums=false`
  - [ ] Implement allow-list filtering for personal albums (empty list = include
        all)
  - [ ] If `personal_album_names_to_include` is filled, a check shall be
        included, which breaks, if the any of the specified albumes does not
        exist
- [ ] Implement **shared album filtering**:
  - [ ] Add `include_shared_albums` boolean configuration parameter
  - [ ] Add `shared_album_names_to_include` comma-separated list parameter
  - [ ] Based `shared_album_names_to_include` in .env a equally named variable
        shall be used inside the python code, which takes the value from .env
        and splits this into single string items, putting them into an list
  - [ ] Implement logic to access shared albums via pyicloud API
  - [ ] Implement allow-list filtering for shared albums (empty list = include
        all)
  - [ ] If `shared_album_names_to_include` is filled, a check shall be included,
        which breaks, if the any of the specified albumes does not exist
- [ ] Enhance **photo enumeration** to support album-based filtering:
  - [ ] Modify photo listing to iterate through selected albums only
  - [ ] Ensure photos from multiple albums are not duplicated
  - [ ] Handle photos that exist in multiple selected albums

#### 2.1.2 Enhanced Photo Tracking

- [ ] Implement **album-aware photo identification**:
  - [ ] Track photos by combination of filename and source album
  - [ ] Handle same photo existing in multiple albums
  - [ ] Update deletion tracking to include album context

  - [ ] Ensure deletion tracking works per album
